In order to run the testing UI you have:
1. Save in the bioBERT_model the bioBert_model.pth (If you do not have it run the script to fine-tune the bioBERT and save it inside this directory)
2. Open and run the chatbot_app
3. Open and run the webside

The UI sends POST AJAX reguests to the flask app that you run through the chatbot_app.py and simulates a conversation.
Instructions etc can be found inside the website.
