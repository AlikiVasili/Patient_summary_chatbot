This frontend is designed to interact with the CareSnap Chatbot, a healthcare chatbot system. It consists of various sections, including About, Instructions, Test User, Questionnaire, and Feedback.

## Instructions

The Instructions section provides guidance on how to use the chatbot. It includes steps to initiate a conversation with the chatbot, such as copying the provided ID, opening the chatbot, pasting the ID, and logging in.

## Test User

The Test User section allows users to test the chatbot using a predefined ID. By providing the ID, users can log in as a test user (e.g., Maria Iosif) and interact with the chatbot.

## Questionnaire

The Questionnaire section prompts users to complete a questionnaire after testing the chatbot. Users can provide feedback on their experience, including comments, suggestions, or reporting problems.

## Feedback

The Feedback section enables users to submit feedback directly through the frontend. Users can select the type of feedback (comments, suggestions, or problems) and provide their input in the text area.

## Chat Container
